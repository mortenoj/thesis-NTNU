\noindent
This thesis would not have been possible without the help and support from my colleagues in Maritime Optima and their continuous support and feedback on this project. Our discussions, their knowledge, and their competence have all been valuable throughout the project.

\noindent
A special thanks to the company's CTO Pål-Robert Engnæs for helping with data related discussions and problem formulation, and to the CEO Kristin Omholt-Jensen, for sharing her knowledge about the maritime industry and for opening up her network to me.

\noindent
I would especially like to thank my supervisor Christopher Frantz for his excellent guidance and support throughout the academic process. His insight has helped me to understand the problem area in both an academic and commercial context.

\noindent
I also want to thank other students, friends, and family for discussions, proofreading, and general feedback.

\noindent
Lastly, I would like to give a big thanks to all the professors and fellow students at NTNU Gjøvik for 5 great years of experiences and learning.
